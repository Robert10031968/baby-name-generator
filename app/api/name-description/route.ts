Write a poetic and imaginative description of the baby name "${name}".
Your answer must contain **at least 3 distinct paragraphs** and be **at least 150 words long**.

Include:
- The etymology and meaning of the name (if known)
- Its historical or cultural use (real or symbolic)
- Notable people or literary references (if any)
- Emotional and symbolic associations
- Phonetic character and overall impression

Even if the name is common or well-known, do not shorten the answer.
Use lyrical language, rich metaphors and evoke emotional imagery.
This should read like a mini-essay or narrative.

Do not list bullet points. Write in flowing prose.
